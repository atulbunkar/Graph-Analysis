DS-LAB Assignment 4: Graph.
Submitted By: 214101011.

To run: keep the input test files in the same folder as main.cpp.

I have explained everything in Program Analysis.pdf and also in program comments.

Note: 
I have provided input file "input.txt" from which I got the graph images that I have shown in the pdf file. 
The nodes in graph is in range 1 to n.  

Note 2: 
For solution 3 , to compare original graph g and minimal edge graph g_min, see the generated images.

To generate 3 images of original graph g: run soln 1, soln 2 and soln 4.
Each will give one image: 

-g_Graph.png : DFS of graph g.
-g_components.png : SCComponents of g.
-g_Component_Graph.png : Connections between components of g. 

The solution 3 will generate 3 images of graph g_min. You can then compare the 3 images respectively.
The solutions can be run in any order.

Note 3: The Component_graph of g and g_min will be same but component label(numbering) will be different as it is not upto me to fix the labels of SCC.
You can check the difference in component label from g_components.png and gmin_components.png
